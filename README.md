## 1. Introduction to Objective-C

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language used for developing macOS and iOS applications. It is a superset of C, meaning that all C programs are valid Objective-C programs. It also incorporates dynamic runtime features from Smalltalk, making it a powerful language for software development.

- **Advantages of Objective-C**:
  - Interoperability with C and C++.
  - Dynamic runtime with message passing.
  - Rich Cocoa framework support for macOS and iOS development.

---

## 2. Basic Syntax

Objective-C uses a slightly different syntax than other object-oriented languages like Java or C++.

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        NSLog(@"Hello, World!");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **`@autoreleasepool`**: Handles memory management.
- **`NSLog`**: Used for output, similar to `printf` in C.
  
---

## 3. Data Types and Variables

Objective-C supports basic data types from C, but also provides some additional types specific to the language.

### Data Types:
- `int` – Integer
- `float` – Floating-point
- `BOOL` – Boolean
- `NSString *` – String object

### Example:
```objc
int number = 42;
float pi = 3.14;
BOOL isComplete = YES;
NSString *greeting = @"Hello, Objective-C!";
```

---

## 4. Operators

Objective-C supports all standard C operators.

### Arithmetic Operators:
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

### Relational Operators:
- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

### Example:
```objc
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int result = a + b;
NSLog(@"The result is %d", result);
```

---

## 5. Control Flow

Objective-C includes all traditional control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `switch`.

### Example:
```objc
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    NSLog(@"You are an adult.");
} else {
    NSLog(@"You are a minor.");
}
```

---

## 6. Functions and Methods

In Objective-C, methods are defined inside classes. Functions can exist globally.

### Example of a Global Function:
```objc
void sayHello() {
    NSLog(@"Hello, from a function!");
}
```

### Example of a Method in a Class:
```objc
@interface Person : NSObject
- (void)greet;
@end

@implementation Person
- (void)greet {
    NSLog(@"Hello from a method!");
}
@end
```

---

## 7. Classes and Objects

Objective-C is a class-based, object-oriented language.

### Example:
```objc
@interface Car : NSObject
@property NSString *model;
- (void)drive;
@end

@implementation Car
- (void)drive {
    NSLog(@"The %@ is driving!", self.model);
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        Car *myCar = [Car new];
        myCar.model = @"Tesla";
        [myCar drive];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **`@interface`**: Declares the class and its properties/methods.
- **`@implementation`**: Defines the implementation of the class methods.

---

## 8. Memory Management

Objective-C uses a system called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, which handles most of the object lifecycle automatically.

### Example:
```objc
Person *john = [Person new]; // The object is retained.
```

If not using ARC, manual memory management involves `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.

---

## 9. Protocols and Delegates

Protocols in Objective-C define a blueprint of methods that can be implemented by any class.

### Example:
```objc
@protocol Speaker
- (void)speak;
@end

@interface Person : NSObject <Speaker>
@end

@implementation Person
- (void)speak {
    NSLog(@"I am speaking.");
}
@end
```

---

## 10. Categories and Extensions

Categories allow you to add methods to an existing class.

### Example:
```objc
@interface NSString (Reverse)
- (NSString *)reverseString;
@end

@implementation NSString (Reverse)
- (NSString *)reverseString {
    NSUInteger length = [self length];
    NSMutableString *reversed = [NSMutableString stringWithCapacity:length];
    for (NSInteger i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        [reversed appendFormat:@"%c", [self characterAtIndex:i]];
    }
    return reversed;
}
@end
```

---

## 11. Blocks

Blocks are similar to closures or lambdas in other languages. They allow you to define chunks of code that can be passed around.

### Example:
```objc
int (^multiplyBlock)(int, int) = ^(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
};
NSLog(@"Result: %d", multiplyBlock(3, 4));
```

---

## 12. Error Handling

Objective-C uses a combination of `NSError` and exception handling for error handling.

### Example:
```objc
NSError *error = nil;
NSString *fileContents = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:@"non_existent_file.txt" encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&error];

if (error) {
    NSLog(@"Error: %@", error.localizedDescription);
}
```

---

## 13. File Handling

Objective-C offers several methods to read/write files using the `NSFileManager` class and `NSString`.

### Example:
```objc
NSString *path = @"/path/to/file.txt";
NSString *content = @"Objective-C is awesome!";
[content writeToFile:path atomically:YES encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];
```

---

## 14. Networking

For networking, you can use the `NSURLSession` API to fetch data from the web.

### Example:
```objc
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://api.example.com/data"];
NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [[NSURLSession sharedSession] dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    if (data) {
        NSString *dataString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
        NSLog(@"Data received: %@", dataString);
    }
}];
[task resume];
```

---

## 15. Advanced Topics

### a. Multithreading
Objective-C provides APIs for multithreading with `NSThread`, GCD, and NSOperationQueue.

### Example:
```objc
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
    NSLog(@"Background thread");
});
```

### b. Key-Value Observing (KVO)
KVO allows you to observe changes to properties.

### Example:
```objc
[self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"propertyName" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:nil];
```
